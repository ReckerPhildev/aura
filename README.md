# DSCKabarak v2

Welcome to the workspace for DSCKabarak v2

v2 is the second iteration of DSCKabarak site, which we are aiming to launch during August 2020. It aims to both add exciting features and fix some of the issues encountered in the initial version. We are a community of developers in campus and as such we are looking forward to bringing everyone on board this includes our faculty at school, our alumnis who's support has been immense and a local ecosystem of programmers in and around campus.

A summary of the main features:

- **Improved profiles of the team:** Profiles will be getting an upgrade to include campus faculty, alumnis, mentors, leads and co-leads to better highlight their work and contact details in order to seamlessly reach out to them if any community member needs help and/or their assistance.
- **Updates on the about page:** We'll need to provide more information of some of our other online platforms, GitHub to be specific in order for visitors of the site to easily navigate to projects done by members of the community.
- **Call for speakers and co-team section:** We are looking forward to providing a platform where students can easily apply tp give talks on google technologies and related topic of their interest and apply to be part of the team passionate to make an impact to the community.

We are busy working away on the product and development work to add all this functionality, but **we need contributors to help get some of the main features to production** as our biggest need right now is for the implimentation of the main features.

Throughout the development of v2, contributors will be creating issues tagged with `status/help-wanted`. You can choose any issue and comment saying you want to work on it, and it will then be "assigned" to you.
